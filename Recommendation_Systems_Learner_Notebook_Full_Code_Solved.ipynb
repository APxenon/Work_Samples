    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "## **Dataset:**\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem"

Similarly for user `userID=A34BZM6S9L7QI4` who has not seen the product, it predicts a rating of 4.19."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "- Four models of recommendation systems were built: Populatrity based recommendation system, User-Similarity recommendation system, Item-Similarity recommendation system and SVD recommendation system.\n",
    "- Popularity based system was used to rank the most popular products through out the whole user base on the site. This system ranked the products independant of the user behaviour or product interactions. Hence, this system is not very useful in giving personalized recommendations.\n",
    "- User-Similarity system was used to suggest recommendations based on similarity between users in the dataset. The model had the worst performance with the highest RMSE of 1.025 with an F-score of 0.82. The system was seen to have very poor precision in predicting the ratings given by users as seen when the system predicted a rating of 3 for a product that was actually rated 5. Even hyperparameter tuning could not improve the performance of the recommendation system. So, User-Similarity recommendation system might not be the best system.\n",
    "- Item-Similarity system was used suggest recommendations based on similarity between products in the dataset. This model had a much better performance with better RMSE at 1.023 but a slightly lower F-score of 0.79. This model was the best performing in predicting the ratings that a user would give a product being able estimate very close to the actual ratings given by users to the items. Hyperparameter tuning provides only minimal improvements to system performance.\n",
    "- Finally, SVD recommendation system was built to recommend based on both users and item interactions. This model had the best performance with a low RMSE of 0.89 and an F-Score of 0.82. The performance of this model was great being able to closely predict the ratings a user would give to a product. Though, it was slightly less accurate than Item-Similarity system. Hyperparameter tuning once again did not result in any improvements in the system performance."

    "### Recommendations\n",
    "- Multiple recommendation systems should be used in conjunction to give the best recommendations to the users.\n",
    "- The popularity based recommendation can be used to give a set of general \"trending products\" recommendations to all users irrespective of their purchase history or interests preferably on the home page. While this may not get a lot users to buy products, it could get users to expand the diversity of products they use and even be recommended products that they would like but are not being recommended as it does not follow their usual purchase habits. This is also a good way to provide a starting point for new customers to buy products and allow Amazon to start building an user profile to start personalizing recommendations.\n",
    "- For personalized recommendations, a mix of Item-Similarity recommendations and SVD-recommendations system should be used.\n",
    "- Item-Similarity recommendation system is suggested to be used to provide very close recommendations to products the user is currently browsing or have recently purchased. These recommendations can be given with the guarantee that the user will be interested in them as they are currently engaged in browsing or purchasing a similar product. Users are probably looking for a few different products of similar nature to compare before buying and using Item-Similarity system would help improve this experience for the user.\n",
    "- SVD recommendation system should be used to provide a diverse range of recommendations based on the users purchase history and browsing habits on both the home page as well as when browsing the marketplace. The system should be used to give recommendations that are not just similar to products the user has liked, but also products that could be adjacent and complimentary to the products bought or being browsed. This could encourage users to branch out from their niche and buy more products.\n",
    "- Finally, User-Similarity recommendation system is not advisable to use based purely on user-item interactions. The system should be complimented with user information such as personal details, geographic data, browsing habits etc."
